            NGC 3982, also known as UGC 6918, is an <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_spiral_galaxy" target="_blank"> intermediate spiral galaxy</a>
            approximately 68 million light-years away in the constellation Ursa Major. It was discovered by William Herschel
            on April 14, 1789 and misclassified as planetary nebula.[4] NGC 3982 is a part of the M109 Group.
            At an apparent magnitude of 12.0, NGC 3982 needs a telescope to be viewed. Using small telescopes, the galaxy
            appears as a very faint, diffuse patch of light with its central region appearing as a slightly brighter diffuse ball
            of light. The galaxy is a part of the M109 group of galaxies.
